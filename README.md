# projet_getdata

The project is based on data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
This project creates creates an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.This is done through the variable "subject_data"
    
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (mean_and_std_features). 
    
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (variable "activities")
    
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject ("averages_data.txt").
